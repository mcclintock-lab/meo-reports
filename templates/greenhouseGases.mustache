A description of each scenario is provided at the bottom of the page.

<p>The reports show greenhouse gas emissions in the following scenarios:
	<p>
		<strong>NO PA 295</strong> - The result of having no Energy Efficiency Resource and Renewable Portfolio Standards. Energy consumption continues to increase with population and employment
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>PA 295</strong> - Michigan's current Energy Efficiency and Renewable Portfolio Standards. Energy consumption is reduced, each year, by 1% of the previous year's total  consumption, and 10% of electricity demand comes from renewable energy sources
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>PA 295 Double</strong> - The result of doubling Michigan's Energy Efficiency Resource and Renewable Portfolio Standards. Energy consumption is reduced, each year, by 2% of the previous year's total consumption, and 20% of electricity demand comes from renewable energy sources.
